                    My path into computer science began in an unexpected place—critical care
                    nursing. As an ICU nurse, I was drawn to complex problem-solving and the
                    analytical mindset required to uncover what’s happening beneath the surface.
                    When I discovered computer science through courses like Harvard’s CS50, I
                    realized that the same curiosity and puzzle-driven thinking applied directly to
                    software. I’m now pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Arizona State University,
                    graduating in May 2026, and I’m excited to continue growing as a developer,
                    contribute to real-world products, and bring my interdisciplinary background
                    into a software engineering role.
