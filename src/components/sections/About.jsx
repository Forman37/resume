                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                    As a critical care nurse, I thrived in complex problem-solving environments and
                    the analytical mindset required to uncover what is happening beneath the
                    surface. When I discovered computer science through courses like Harvard’s CS50,
                    I realized that the same curiosity and puzzle-driven thinking applied directly
                    to software. I’m now pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Arizona State
                    University, graduating in May 2026, and I’m excited to continue growing as a
                    developer, contribute to real-world products, and bring my interdisciplinary
                    background into a software engineering role.
